Asteroids-Processing\
\
This program is a "clone" of the game asteroids. It uses the same gameplay\
as the original with some different control schemes.\
\
This program was created using Eclipse and if you wish to compile\
I would suggest you use it as well..\
\
In order to use you must call \
\
java -jar Asteroids.jar\
\
This will launch the game and put you at the Menu Screen.\
\
If in keyboard mode\
\
left rotates ship left, right rotates ship right and up accelerates\
\
T toggles the color mode\
M toggles mouse mode\
Enter will pause/resume game\
\
If in mouse mode\
\
The ship auto moves to your mouse location just put the mouse on screen\
where you want the ship to move. Left mouse click will fire your weapon \
straight ahead of the front of the ship.\
\
\
\
PS\
I included the firing by mouse towards direction of the mouse however\
it is not enabled by default. I put the code to make it fire in that direction however\
it is located inside of the Main class and is commented better there for how to make the switch.}
